<h3><FONT COLOR="GREEN"> -<p style="font-size:27px">Types:-</FONT COLOR></h3>
<p>Among the types of peanut butter are</p>
<p><FONT COLOR="BLUE"><p style="font-size:21px">1.conventional peanut butter, which consists of up to 10% salt, sugars, and hydrogenated vegetable oil.</FONT COLOR></p>
<br>
<p><FONT COLOR="MAROON"><p style="font-size:21px">2. crunchy or chunky peanut butter, which includes coarsely-ground peanut fragments to give extra texture</FONT COLOR></p>
<br>
<p><FONT COLOR="DARKBLUE"><p style="font-size:21px">3. smooth peanut butter, in which the peanuts are ground uniformly, possibly with the addition of corn syrup and vegetable oil, to create a thick, creamy texture like butter</FONT COLOR></p> 
<br>
<p><FONT COLOR="RED"><p style="font-size:21px">4. natural peanut butter, which normally contains only peanuts and salt and is sold without emulsifiers that bind the peanut oils with the peanut paste, and so requires stirring to recombine the ingredients before consumption</FONT COLOR></p>
<br>
<p><FONT COLOR="DARKPINK"><p style="font-size:21px">5. organic and artisanal peanut butters, whose markets are small; artisanal peanut butter is usually preservative-free, additive-free, and handmade in a cottage industry-style setup used first around 1970.</FONT COLOR></p>
<br>
<h2><p style="background-color:yellow;"><FONT COLOR="DARKBLUE">Production Process✔️</h2></p></FONT COLOR></FONT COLOR>
<h3><p style="background-color:LIGHTYELLOW;"><FONT COLOR="DARKRED">Planting and harvesting</h3></FONT COLOR>

<p>Due to weather conditions, peanuts are usually planted in spring. The peanut comes from a yellow flower that bends over and penetrates the soil after blooming and wilting, and the peanut starts to grow in the soil. Peanuts are harvested from late August to October, while the weather is clear. This weather allows for dry soil so that when picked, the soil does not stick to the stems and pods. The peanuts are then removed from vines and transported to a peanut shelling machine for mechanical drying. After cropping, the peanuts are delivered to warehouses for cleaning, where they are stored unshelled in silos</p>
<br>

<h3><p style="background-color:LIGHTPINK;"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">Shelling</p></h3></FONT COLOR>
<p>Shelling must be conducted carefully lest the seeds be damaged during the removal of the shell. The moisture of the unshelled peanuts is controlled to avoid excessive frangibility of the shells and kernels, which in turn, reduces the amount of dust present in the plant.After, the peanuts are sent to a series of rollers set specifically for the batch of peanuts, where they are cracked. After cracking, the peanuts go through a screening process where they are inspected for contaminants.</p>
<br>
<h2><p style="background-color:LIGHTYELLOW;"><FONT COLOR="DARKRED">Roasting</h2></FONT COLOR>
<p>The dry roasting process employs either the batch or continuous method. In the batch method, peanuts are heated in large quantities in a revolving oven at about 800 °F (430 °C).Next, the peanuts in each batch are uniformly held and roasted in the oven at 320 °F (160 °C) for about 40 to 60 minutes.This method is good to use when the peanuts differ in moisture content. In the continuous method, a hot air roaster is employed. The peanuts pass through the roaster whilst being rocked to permit even roasting. A photometer indicates the completion of dry roasting.This method is favored by large manufacturers since it can lower the rate of spoilage and requires less labor.</p>
<br>
<h2><p style="background-color:LIGHTLKHAKI;">Cooling</h2>
<p> After dry roasting, peanuts are removed from the oven as quickly as possible and directly placed in a blower-cooler cylinder.There are suction fans in the metal cylinder that can pull a large volume of air through, so the peanuts can be cooled more efficiently. The peanuts will not be dried out because cooling can help retain some oil and moisture.The cooling process is completed when the temperature in the cylinder reaches 86 °F (30 °C).</p>
<h2><p style="background-color:LIGHTYELLOW;"><FONT COLOR="DARKBLUE">Blanching</P></h2></FONT COLOR>
After the kernels have been cooled down, the peanuts will undergo either heat blanching or water blanching to remove the remaining seed coats. Compared to heat blanching, water blanching is a new process. Water blanching first appeared in 1949.[25]

<h2><p style="background-color:LIGHTYELLOW;"><FONT COLOR="BLACK">Heat blanching</h2></FONT COLOR></p>
<p>Peanuts are heated by hot air at 280 °F (138 °C) for not more than 20 minutes in order to soften and split the skins. After that, the peanuts are exposed to continuous steam in a blanching machine. The skins are then removed using either bristles or soft rubber belts. After that, these skins are separated and blown into waste bags. Meanwhile, the hearts of peanuts are segregated through inspection.</p>

<h2><p style="background-color:LIGHTYELLOW;"><FONT COLOR="DARKRED">Water blanching</h2></FONT COLOR>
After the kernels are arranged in troughs, the skin of the kernel is cracked on opposite sides by rolling it through sharp stationary blades. While the skins are removed, the kernels are brought through a one-minute hot water bath and placed on a swinging pad with canvas on top. The swinging action of the pad rubs off the skins. Afterward, the blanched kernels are dried for at least six hours by hot air at 120 °F (49 °C).</p>

After blanching, the peanuts are screened and inspected to eliminate the burnt and rotten peanuts. A blower is also used to remove light peanuts and discolored peanuts are removed using a color sorting machine.

<h2><p style="background-color:LIGHTYELLOW;"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">Grinding</h2></FONT COLOR>
<p>After blanching the peanuts are sent to grinding to be manufactured into peanut butter. The peanuts are then sent through two sizes of grinders. The first grinder produces a medium grind, and the second produces a fine grind.[25] At this point, salt, sugar and a vegetable oil stabilizer may be added to the fine grind; this adds flavor and allows the peanut butter to stay as a homogeneous mixture.[28] Chopped peanuts may also be added at this stage to produce "chunky" peanut butter.</p>

<h2><p style="background-color:KHAKI;"><FONT COLOR="VOILET">Packaging</h2></FONT COLOR>
<p> Before packaging, the peanut butter must first be cooled in order to be sealed in jars.[25] The mixture is pumped into a heat exchanger in order to cool it to about 120 °F (49 °C).[28] Once cool, the peanut butter is pumped into jars and vacuum-sealed, a process which removes air and deoxygenates the peanut butter to inhibit its oxidation.[citation needed] The jars are then labeled and set aside until crystallization occurs. The peanut butter jars are then packaged into cartons distributed to retailers, where they are stored at room temperature and sold to consumers.</p>

A 2012 article stated that "China and India are the first and second-largest producers, respectively", of peanuts.[13] The United States of America "...is the third-largest producer of peanuts (Georgia and Texas are the two major peanut-producing states)"[13] and "more than half of the American peanut crop goes into making peanut butter."[13]

<h2><p style="background-color:LIGHTYELLOW;"><FONT COLOR="DARKRED">Consumption</h2></FONT COLOR>
<p>The United States is a leading exporter of peanut butter, and one of the largest consumers of peanut butter annually per capita.[29] January 24 is National Peanut Butter Day in the United States.[30] In March 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, retail sales of peanut butter in the United States increased by 75% over the level in March 2019.</p>

According to Jon Krampner's 2013 book on peanut butter, per capita consumption of peanut butter in Canada and the Netherlands – the largest consumer per capita in Europe – exceed that in the United States.[32]

In Israel, the peanut-butter-flavored puffcorn snack Bamba accounts for 25% of the snack market;[33] its consumption by infants has been linked to a low incidence of peanut allergies among Israelis
